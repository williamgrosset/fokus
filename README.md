*Google chrome extension to help you focus on the things that really matter.*


## F.A.Q.
### Why am I making this?
Lately, I have started to notice that I subconciously and instinctively go to websites that I do not actually want to be on. Whether it is Facebook, Twitch, Reddit, or any other domain - when I am working, I want to be completely focused on the things that matter in the present moment. We are all guilty of this, but we can fix it.

### "This problem has already been solved."
Yes, but not in the design I think it should be.

### Do you realize you spelt "focus" wrong?
Yes. Fokus is swedish for focus (I know, it's pretty original). It is *obviously* too mainstream to name this extension "focus." :godmode:

## Design
### November 10th, 2016
My plans right now are to make the domains I want blocked directly embedded into the source code. There are great things to come in terms of usability; however, I will keep those details disclosed for now.
