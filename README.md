*Google chrome extension to help you focus on the things that really matter.*


## F.A.Q.
### Why am I making this?
Lately, I have started to notice that I subconciously go to websites that I do not actually want to be on. As individuals, we seek stimulus, so we happen to jump on board with anything to distract our mind. Whether it is Facebook, Twitch, Reddit, or any other domain - when I am working, I want to be completely focused on the things that currently important. We are all guilty of this, but we can fix it. Also, this allows me to spread something that is important to me, which is individuals being more mindful through the use of meditation.

### "This problem has already been solved."
Not exactly. Most extensions are a bit overkill with their design and functionality. I want to build something that I can use everyday!

### Do you realize you spelt "focus" wrong?
Yes. Fokus is swedish for focus (I know, it's pretty original). :godmode:

## Development Updates
### November 10th, 2016
My plans right now are to make the domains I want blocked directly embedded into the source code. There are great things to come in terms of usability; however, I will keep those details disclosed for now.

### November 23rd, 2016.
Semester is extremely busy, but the main page of the extension is coming along nicely. I need to find a huge text file of quotes...
