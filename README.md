## F.A.Q.
### Why am I making this?
I have started to notice that I subconciously go to websites that I do not actually want to be on. Individuals seek stimulus, so we happen to distract our mind when we get bored. Whether it is Facebook, Twitch, Reddit, or any other domain - when I am working, I want to be completely focused on what is currently important. We are all guilty of this, but we can fix it. I also really wanted to learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

### "Domain blocking has already been solved."
Not exactly. Most extensions are a bit overkill with their design and functionality. I want to build something that I can easily use everyday and be able to practice meditation when I need it the most.

### Do you realize you spelt "focus" wrong?
Yes. Fokus is swedish for focus (I know, it's pretty original). :godmode:
