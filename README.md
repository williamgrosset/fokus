*Google chrome extension to help you focus on the things that really matter.*


## F.A.Q.
### Why am I making this?
Lately, I have started to notice that I subconciously go to websites that I do not actually want to be on. Individuals seek stimulus, so we happen to jump on board with anything to distract our mind. Whether it is Facebook, Twitch, Reddit, or any other domain - when I am working, I want to be completely focused on the things that are currently important. We are all guilty of this, but we can fix it.

### "This problem has already been solved."
Not exactly. Most extensions are a bit overkill with their design and functionality. I want to build something that I can use everyday and be able to practice meditation when I need it the most.

### Do you realize you spelt "focus" wrong?
Yes. Fokus is swedish for focus (I know, it's pretty original). :godmode:
